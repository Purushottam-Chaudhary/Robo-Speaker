Robo-Speaker is a simple Python-based Text-to-Speech (TTS) application that uses pyttsx3 for speech synthesis and tkinter for creating a graphical user interface (GUI). This application allows the user to input text and hear it spoken out loud at the click of a button.

Requirements-
(I)  pyttsx3: Text-to-speech conversion library.
(II) tkinter: Standard Python library for creating GUI applications.

Usage-
(I)   Enter the text you want the RoboSpeaker to speak into the input field.
(II)  Click on the "Speak" button, and RoboSpeaker will read the text aloud.
(III) The speech rate is set to 150 words per minute, but you can adjust it 
      within the code by modifying the engine.setProperty('rate', 150) line.
